<br>
In the United States, education has long been hailed as a gateway to economic opportunity and social mobility. However, despite significant strides in women's educational attainment, the prevalence of poverty among women aged 18-44 remains a persistent issue. With 29 million women holding college degrees in 2019, one would expect a commensurate decline in poverty rates among this group. Despite educational achievements, 28.3% of women aged 18-44 in the United States were living in poverty that year.<br>
<br>
States such as New Mexico, Mississippi, and Louisiana stand out as particularly concerning, with more than 40% of women aged 18-44 living in poverty. Additionally, 18 states reported poverty levels among women at 30% or higher.<br>
